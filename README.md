## Project Goals

Build a web application capable of selecting an MP4 recording from an AWS S3. The web application should be capable of using FFMPEG to select a portion of an MP4 file for download. The web application should be user-friendly and have minimalist features to enable a quick and easy user experience. 

The web application could also possibly upload the content directly to Vimeo to reduce the time spent using the web application. 

### User Goals

To use a web application capable of downloading a specific selection of a recording that is needed for business. To have the option to use an application that lessens the need for a tech-savvy user to perform these actions.

The web application should be straightforward to use so that anyone performing this task can easily understand how to operate the web application.
